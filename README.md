# Fit-Lit-Refactor-Tractor

As a team, we were tasked to refactor a pre-existing repo called, Fit-Lit. Fit-Lit is an app that tracks a user's hydration, activity, and sleep. The app also includes user information such days active, daily step goal, friends list, and more!

While refactoring, we added 3 buttons at the top of the screen called, 'Update Activity', 'Update Sleep', and 'Update Hydration'. Upon clicking these buttons, the user can fill in their updated information for each activity and submit. Upon submitting, this information is posting the new information to the API. Otherwise, they can click the back button to return to the home screen.

## Setup

That's right, _clone_ not fork. You will use this repo multiple times, but you can only fork a repository once. So here is what you need to do to clone the repo and still be able to push changes to your repo:

1. Clone down this repo
2. Install the library dependencies. Run: 
```
npm install
```
3. Then, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the page there! Then, you can enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
